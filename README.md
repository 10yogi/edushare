Edu Share is a web based social application in which a user can connect to other users and can share only educational articles with other users.
Edu Share is different from other social platforms because it only accepts educational articles to be shared by detecting irrelevant posts through its machine learning based content detection service for various categories such as educational detection, commercial detection, adult content detection and spam detection.
